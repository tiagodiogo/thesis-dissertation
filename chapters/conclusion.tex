\label{chapter:conclusion}
Due to the limitations of \gls{IoT} devices, achieving secure communications is not an easy task. In order to allow the deployment of battery powered nodes, their communication model must be very efficient and consume the minimum amount of power required for operation. To achieve those requirements we started by analysing the existing protocols across the OSI layers, trying to find the best suited solutions for this type of environments. After a thorough comparison we achieved a working stack of protocols but soon discovered possible breaches and attacks, especially on the network layer. Those attacks were further investigated and catalogued. Given the common principle on the majority of the attacks, the introduction of rogue nodes to the network, we presented some possible solutions based on secure bootstrapping, the secure authentication of new nodes when joining a network.\\
Once the energy efficient stack, possible attacks and mitigation strategies were defined, we proposed our solution based on a Smart Campus scenario. This solution is focused on providing the joining devices all the secure credentials required for a secure bootstrapping before the deploy on the field, so that when they start the operation phase no additional credentials need to be fetched, implying that no additional energy is spent on configuration.\\
The achieved solution was then evaluated and the results confirm that it us suitable for operation since it fits the hardware commonly used in the \gls{IoT} while maintaining a low power consumption. Also, experiments show that the bootstrapping process can be done by users without inner knowledge of the system and without requiring much time to complete. Furthermore, although the network faces severe disruption in the presence of Wi-Fi networks, it can still operate under stress with diminished performance.
