The \gls{IoT} and its vision of connecting every device to one another and to the Internet presents an opportunity to create large information sharing networks. However, intruders can capture \gls{IoT} devices and take advantage of their constrained nature to disrupt these networks and launch a wide range of attacks on its nodes. In our work we address this security concern from a power-aware perspective, because typical devices have limited power available and they need to judiciously decide what to do with it. This work identified the relation between security and resource consumption. To achieve this objective we do a thorough analysis of the existing protocols, attacks and mitigation strategies, combining that information into our proposed bootstrapping and network management system -- AutoStrap -- evaluated on a Smart Campus scenario. Furthermore, we perform energy, space and time profiling of the network devices to provide future users with the knowledge of what kind of physical resources to deploy based on the desired application security level.
